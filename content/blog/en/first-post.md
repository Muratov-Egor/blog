Hello everyone!

I'm Egor and I'm a diver üëèüèº ü§ø

This is my first post in my blog where I plan to talk about various diving-related things. But I should start with how I got into it.

About 7-8 years ago, I went to a music and water sports festival somewhere near Anapa. As part of the purchased ticket, I had access to an activity like scuba diving. In reality, it looked like this: I was given a wetsuit, they helped me put on a BCD, and we went to a depth of 1.5 meters where they started teaching me how to breathe underwater.

"Hold this thing with your lips and put your head underwater" - said the instructor.

The depth was 1.5 meters right next to the beach, somewhere near Anapa, which means sandy bottom, resulting in zero visibility. And it all lasted about 10 minutes =) But even with all this, after this "dive" I decided that I wanted to try diving, but for real this time.

In 2022, I came to live and work in Phuket and finally decided to fulfill my long-time dream and took the Open Water Diver course.

The instructor was recommended to me by a colleague from work, and it was an excellent recommendation, as I can confidently say that he is definitely one of the reasons why I decided to pursue diving and not stop at the basic certificate.

After completing the course, I went to the store to buy "just a mask and fins and nothing else" to comfortably go diving once or twice a month. As a result, six months later, I had a complete set of equipment, and I go diving almost every week.

To extend the diving experience, I bought a GoPro and started an [Instagram](https://instagram.com/diver_egor) where I post videos of fish I met underwater. I believe that watching videos and identifying encountered fish is also a big part of why I enjoy diving.

Recently, I realized that I want to share my experiences and knowledge with others, which is why the idea of starting a diving blog and writing notes about it came up. Let's see what comes of it)
