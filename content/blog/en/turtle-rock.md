The Phi Phi Islands archipelago, located between the provinces of Phuket and Krabi, is one of Thailand's most famous tourist destinations.

It includes several islands, the most famous of which is [Phi Phi Leh](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5/@7.6857307,98.7560503,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x304e20a33b96bd65:0x183d077e0ecb38e4!8m2!3d7.6804638!4d98.7687699!16zL20vMDFodzhj?entry=ttu). The island consists of towering limestone formations, for which the area is famous. And underwater lies a huge coral reef which is a National Marine Park. Thus, this place combines beauty both underwater and above water. The island became famous after Maya Bay was featured in the movie ['The Beach'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163978/) starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

Just to the left of this bay – in the neighboring Malong Bay – lies the dive site Turtle Rock, which this article is dedicated to.

The dive site got its name thanks to the sea [turtles](https://diversnotes.com/database/green-sea-turtle/) that are often encountered here. The turtles have become accustomed to divers and pay them no attention. But you shouldn't get too close, and certainly don't touch the turtle, or it might decide to flee and start ascending rapidly. And while such an ascent isn't dangerous for the turtle, a rapid ascent can cause problems for a diver. But even without turtles, this is a very pleasant place to dive.

Diving here is relatively simple and rarely affected by currents, which creates ideal conditions for divers of all training levels.

Most dives at Turtle Rock start in the shallows at the base of the reef and, depending on where the boat anchors, you should keep the wall on your left or right during the dive.

Almost the entire length of the dive site features a plateau, rarely exceeding 5-6 meters in depth. The reef slopes down to 14-16 meters and mainly consists of rocks covered with hard corals. Deeper, a sandy bottom begins, where you can find seahorses, rays, and sometimes [zebra sharks](https://diversnotes.com/database/zebra-shark/).

The area is interspersed with large stones and boulders that once fell into the water from the sheer cliff and now create interesting swim-throughs and small caves.

Common reef fish inhabit the area; octopuses, [spiny lobsters](https://diversnotes.com/database/panulirus-versicolor/), and [cuttlefish](https://diversnotes.com/database/pharaoh_cuttlefish/) are frequently seen. And you can always spot several [triggerfish](https://diversnotes.com/database/titan-triggerfish/) and [moray eels](https://diversnotes.com/database/giant-moray/).

Near the southern corner between the bays, there is an area with beautiful soft corals and rock formations that attract giant schools of snappers. And if you swim closer to the island, you can discover a grotto that can be explored.

A safety stop should be considered before entering the grotto, as the entrance starts at 7-8 meters, but upon reaching the end, the depth is only about two meters. Surfacing inside, you find yourself in a natural chamber where you can view stalactites hanging directly from the ceiling. Swimming through the cave, you can feel the massiveness of the mountain above you as the light inside gradually dims.

Although this is an easy dive site, it is important to choose your ascent location carefully in a safe zone. The movement of speedboats entering Maya Bay poses a significant danger.

Overall, this is a very good dive site that almost guarantees turtle sightings and can offer many pleasant surprises.
