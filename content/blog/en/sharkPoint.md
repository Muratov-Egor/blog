Shark Point, also known as Hin Musang ('wild cat rock' in Thai), is located in the open sea between the islands of Phuket and [Phi Phi](https://diversnotes.com/tags/%D0%BF%D1%85%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%85%D0%B8/). The dive site is famous for its pink-purple coral gardens and [zebra sharks](https://diversnotes.com/database/zebra-shark/). Shark Point has been part of a marine sanctuary since 1992, where fishing is prohibited, making it an excellent place to explore the underwater world of the Andaman Sea.

Shark Point was named due to frequent encounters with [zebra sharks](https://diversnotes.com/database/zebra-shark/) peacefully resting on the sandy bottom. Although the number of sharks here has decreased due to the increase in boats heading to the site, the place remains one of the most beautiful for diving thanks to its healthy coral reef and diverse marine life.

The dive site consists of a group of underwater rock formations (pinnacles), separated by small gaps. They are aligned one after another from north to south at depths ranging from 5 meters to over 25 meters. Each subsequent pinnacle is slightly lower and slightly deeper than the previous one.

Diving is accessible for divers of all certification levels, although strong currents and variable visibility can make it challenging for the less experienced.

Diving at Shark Point typically takes place only on the first three pinnacles – two of which do not reach the surface, while the third, northernmost one, marked by a small lighthouse, protrudes just a few meters. The lighthouse on the pinnacle serves as an important navigational aid, guiding boats safely around the dive site and helping divers locate key points of interest. Divers usually enter the water near this northernmost pinnacle. Depending on the direction and strength of the current, divers move along the east or west side of the rock. If the current is not strong, it's possible to circle the first pinnacle and then head south towards the second one.

The second pinnacle has a gentle slope on its north side and ends with a vertical wall to the south. The top of this wall is at a depth of 5-6 meters, which allows for a comfortable safety stop even in very strong currents – just hide behind the rock and, while the mandatory three minutes pass, admire the beautiful soft corals covering the top of the pinnacle.

On the second pinnacle, you can find the largest gorgonian sea fans and barrel sponges among all the dive sites around Phuket and Phi Phi. As this reef is quite isolated, it attracts a huge number of diverse schooling fish, such as barracudas, batfish, [trevallies](https://diversnotes.com/database/giant-trevally/), yellow snappers, tuna, and other snappers/groupers, as well as numerous macro inhabitants, including seahorses and ghost pipefish.

Additionally, at Shark Point, you can encounter [cuttlefish](https://diversnotes.com/database/pharaoh_cuttlefish/) and squid, which often hide in various shelters. The site is also famous for its diverse soft corals and anemones inhabiting the underwater rocks. Among the multicolored coral diversity live various types of moray eels, from the [small fimbriated moray](https://diversnotes.com/database/fimbriated-moray/) to [giant](https://diversnotes.com/database/giant-moray/) and zebra morays. Colorful [lionfish](https://diversnotes.com/database/red-lionfish/), octopuses, cute little Nemo fish (clownfish), parrotfish, giant clams, nudibranchs, and seahorses for macro photography enthusiasts – this is just an incomplete list of what divers might see when diving on this remarkable reef. The presence of currents and abundant plankton attracts large marine animals such as manta rays and whale sharks.
