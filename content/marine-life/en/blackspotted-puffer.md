The **Blackspotted puffer** is a marine inhabitant with a rounded gray or brownish-gray body, sometimes having a dark brown or yellowish hue. Irregular black spots are scattered across its body and snout, and the rims around the eyes and mouth have a black, soot-like tinge.

This species inhabits coral reef areas and areas near rocks at depths ranging from 3 to 35 meters. The Blackspotted puffer prefers a solitary lifestyle, often resting motionless on corals. Its diet consists of corals, sponges, and algae. When threatened, the puffer inflates itself with air and water, transforming into a defensive ball.
