The redtail butterflyfish has a distinctive dark body with a fine mesh-like texture created by its scales. Its tail fin is bright red, making it easy to identify. A white stripe crosses its head vertically, starting behind the eyes. The pectoral fins are gray, and the dorsal fin is adorned with a row of spines.

This species is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region, including the waters around Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It prefers coral reefs at depths of up to 30 meters.

The redtail butterflyfish primarily feeds on coral polyps, small invertebrates, and algae. In the wild, it is often seen delicately scraping food from coral surfaces.

This fish poses no danger to humans. It is peaceful and non-aggressive toward divers and other marine life.
