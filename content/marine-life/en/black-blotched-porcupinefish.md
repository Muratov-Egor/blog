The **Black-blotched porcupinefish** is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region. It inhabits reefs and reef slopes. During the day, it prefers to hide, emerging only at night to hunt. It can be found at depths down to 40 meters, while juveniles prefer to inhabit lagoons and estuaries.

The Black-blotched porcupinefish is a medium-sized fish, reaching lengths of up to 65 cm, although individuals around 45 cm are more commonly encountered. The fish's body is elongated, with a well-proportioned head shape and prominent round eyes. The fins typically have a uniform white or light-yellow hue. Body coloration varies from light sandy to light brown. The fish's body is covered in short spines, which it can inflate when threatened, creating an imposing appearance and defending against predators. These spines, as well as the liver, skin, and internal organs, contain the poison tetrodotoxin.
