Fish of the genus *Platax* belong to the spadefish family (Ephippidae) within the order Perciformes. This genus includes five species of marine fish found primarily in the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Their habitat range extends from the coast of Africa (including the Red Sea and Madagascar) potentially to the Atlantic coast of North America around Florida (mainly as introductions), and across the Pacific Ocean up to southern Japan. The greatest diversity and abundance of *Platax* are observed in the Indo-West Pacific, off the coasts of Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, and Australia.

Batfish (*Platax*) are relatively large fish, with the maximum length reaching about 70 cm (specifically, *Platax teira*, the **Teira batfish**). They prefer reef zones but can also be found in open water at depths down to 50 m, most often singly or in small groups. Their diet includes algae, invertebrates (including jellyfish), and small fish. Batfish play an important role in coral reef ecosystems by feeding on certain types of algae and preventing them from overgrowing corals.

Juvenile batfish possess unique defense mechanisms. The first mechanism involves mimicking surrounding objects. Juvenile *Platax orbicularis*, for example, resemble fallen mangrove leaves due to their coloration and swimming style. The second mechanism is imitating venomous animals that predators avoid. Juvenile *Platax pinnatus* are colored and move similarly to toxic flatworms of the genus *Pseudoceros*, making them less vulnerable.

With age, batfish change their shape and coloration (ontogenetic changes). Young fish have elongated dorsal and anal fins, and their bodies are colored in yellow or orange tones with three black bars. As they mature, the fins shorten, the bars fade, and the body takes on a silvery color with vertical bars on the front part.

Batfish pose no danger to divers and often show curiosity towards them. They readily allow humans to approach, making them popular subjects for underwater observation.

Batfish play a critical role in maintaining coral reef health by consuming algae that other fish species do not eat. This prevents excessive algal growth and allows corals to grow and thrive. Studies on the Great Barrier Reef have shown that a decline in batfish populations can lead to the degradation of reef ecosystems.

Batfish are unique fish, important to coral reef ecosystems, possessing interesting biological features and complex defense mechanisms. Their role in maintaining reef health and their appeal to divers make them important subjects for both scientific research and ecotourism.
