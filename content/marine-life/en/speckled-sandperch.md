The **Speckled sandperch (Parapercis hexophtalma)** is a member of the genus *Parapercis*. Males and females exhibit differences in appearance (sexual dimorphism).

The Speckled sandperch has a slightly compressed cylindrical body that tapers towards the rear. The eyes are positioned high on the head, close together. The lips of this fish are quite fleshy. The dorsal fin extends along the body, and the anal fin, which begins mid-body, is also proportionally long. The pelvic fins are also long.

Females have a row of spots along the upper part of the body and 7-8 vertical bars on the belly. Some of these bars may feature yellow spots outlined in black. The face is covered with small speckles. There is a noticeable black spot on the tail (caudal fin base).

Males are larger than females and have a row of spots along the back. The bars on the belly are lighter, and there are typically three yellow spots outlined in black, low on the mid-belly. The face is adorned with yellow and black lines. They can grow up to a maximum length of 17 cm. [Note: Other sources report larger maximum sizes].

Speckled sandperch are usually found on sandy patches and among rubble between reefs. They perch on the bottom, resting on their pectoral fins, and make sharp upward darts. They appear to have very good eyesight. When a diver approaches, they usually remain on the bottom, but if approached too closely, the fish quickly swim away. They can often be seen in pairs.

The Speckled sandperch is found in the Indo-West Pacific. They typically inhabit sandy and gravelly areas between reefs. They can be found at depths down to 18 meters.

Speckled sandperch feed on zooplankton, small crustaceans, and fish.

Little is known about the mating habits of this species. Like most sandperches, they are sequential hermaphrodites, starting their adult life as females and later becoming males (protogyny), likely influenced by social cues. Females significantly outnumber males, and each male guards a harem of two or three females. Spawning occurs at sunset. The male and female rise above the bottom and release eggs and sperm into the water.
