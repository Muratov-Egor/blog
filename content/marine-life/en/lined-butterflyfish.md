The **Lined butterflyfish (Chaetodon lineolatus)** is a representative and one of the largest species in its genus. Its main body color is milky-white with a silvery tint, complemented by alternating vertical black lines on the sides. On the posterior upper part of the body, there is a distinctive elongated, crescent-shaped black patch that touches the bases of the unpaired fins (dorsal and anal), below which extends a diffuse yellow area. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are colored yellow. A broad vertical black bar runs through the eye, and a light spot is visible on the forehead.

This species inhabits various regions of the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa to Hawaii and the Marquesas Islands. Its distribution range extends north to Japan and south to the Great Barrier Reef. In Micronesia, the Lined butterflyfish is found throughout.

This species lives in lagoons and on outer reef slopes, usually forming pairs in areas densely populated with corals. Its main diet consists of polyps from both hard and soft corals, as well as anemones. Additionally, its diet includes small invertebrates and algae.
