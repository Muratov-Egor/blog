The **Painted spiny lobster (Panulirus versicolor)** is a species of spiny lobster found on tropical reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. Other common names include Painted rock lobster, Common rock lobster, Bamboo lobster, Blue lobster, and Blue spiny lobster.

The Painted spiny lobster grows up to 40 centimeters in length, but typically does not exceed 30 cm. It lacks claws, has two thorny rostra above the eyes, and two pairs of large antennae, like all spiny lobsters. The first pair of antennae (antennules) are double-ended, the second pair are stiff and spiny; both pairs of antennae are usually white. The exoskeleton of the Painted spiny lobster, composed of chitin, is very hard and non-stretchable. The coloration of the carapace is white, pink, and black, with horizontal bands and a reticulated pattern. The abdomen is green with transverse black and white bands. The legs are dark blue to black with white stripes, and the tail fan is blue-green. The tail fan consists of five appendages (uropods and telson), yellowish at the base, with a terminal blue area and a white margin.

Reproduction usually occurs in summer but can happen year-round. Mating occurs belly to belly after a courtship display. The spermatophore released by the male adheres to the female's sternum for several weeks. Females carry the eggs, numbering several hundred thousand, under their abdomen. A long oceanic larval phase follows, involving several molts.

These spiny lobsters are nocturnal and solitary. During the day, they hide in small caves and crevices in reefs or under corals. They are carnivorous, feeding on both carrion and freshly caught arthropods, other crustaceans, and occasionally small fish.
