The yellowtail wrasse (Coris gaimard) undergoes significant color changes as it matures. Juveniles are bright red with large white spots outlined in black. As they grow, their appearance transforms: the face and fins develop a pinkish hue (except for the vivid yellow tail fin), while the body turns greenish at the front, darkens toward the tail, and becomes adorned with bright blue spots. Adult individuals can reach up to 40 cm in length, although most grow no longer than 20 cm.

This fish is a predator, feeding on small fish, crustaceans, and worms.

Reproduction occurs through egg-laying in open water, where the eggs drift freely until they hatch. In aquarium conditions, breeding this species is challenging and rarely attempted.

The yellowtail wrasse inhabits the warm waters of the central Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to the Society Islands and Hawaii, reaching from Japan to Australia. It resides in coral reefs, favoring areas with a mix of sandy patches, rubble, and coral, at depths ranging from 1 to 50 meters.

This species is known for its ability to bury itself in the sand, particularly at night or when threatened.
