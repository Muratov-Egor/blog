The **Humpnose big-eye bream (Monotaxis grandoculis)**, also known as the Short-snouted pentapod, is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region. This species inhabits its home reef throughout its life and is found at depths down to 100 meters. Divers most often encounter individuals of this emperor fish (lethrinid) either singly or in groups of up to 50, at depths ranging from 5 to 30 meters.

The dorsal fin of the Humpnose big-eye bream consists of 10 spines and the same number (10) of soft rays; the anal fin contains 3 spines and 9 soft rays. The fish's body typically has a bluish-gray hue, transitioning to lighter on the belly area. The lips can have a yellowish to pinkish tint. A yellowish-orange coloration is often observed around the eyes. The fins lack distinct markings; the membranes often have a reddish or yellowish-orange hue. The caudal fin typically features black rays contrasting with the lighter, pale membrane. Juveniles are characterized by three alternating white and black transverse bands on the dorsal fin.

Adult Humpnose big-eye bream can reach sizes up to 60 cm, but individuals no longer than 40 cm and weighing up to 6 kg are more commonly encountered.

This species primarily feeds on gastropod mollusks, brittle stars, sea urchins, crabs, polychaetes, and, less frequently, tunicates and holothurians (sea cucumbers).
