The **Giant moray (Gymnothorax javanicus)** is one of the two largest species of moray eels. It reaches sizes of up to 3 meters in length and can weigh up to 30 kg, with a lifespan of approximately 36 years.

Juveniles have a brownish-yellow coloration with numerous large black spots. Adult giant morays have a camouflage pattern resembling leopard spots. The head, upper body, and fins are yellowish-brown with various large black spots. The ventral side (underside) is patternless.

The moray's body is laterally compressed and covered with a layer of mucus, which allows for safe gliding and entry into shelters, and also protects against mechanical damage and parasites.

The dorsal fin extends along the entire body, aiding in propulsion and maneuverability.

The huge mouth of the Giant moray is filled with sharp, fang-like teeth located on two sets of jaws â€“ the second pair (pharyngeal jaws) is situated deep in the throat but can be extended forward to grasp prey and transport it to the esophagus.

This moray species is distributed throughout the tropical zone of the Indo-Pacific region. It inhabits clear lagoons and seaward reef slopes. It is often found along deep drop-offs and slopes, preferring a benthic lifestyle. Juveniles hide in the intertidal zone of flat coral reefs.

Giant morays occupy the top of the food chain and are believed to have no natural predators. Conversely, adult morays often attack reef sharks. However, their diet usually consists mainly of fish, and occasionally crustaceans.
