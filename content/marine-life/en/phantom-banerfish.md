The **Phantom Bannerfish (Heniochus pleurotaenia)** is a marine fish of the butterflyfish family (Chaetodontidae), found in the central Indo-Pacific region. It inhabits coral-rich areas of lagoons and coastal reefs, where it is found in pairs or aggregations.

In Indonesia, they are typically observed in pairs in coastal waters, whereas in offshore areas these fish may form groups, and in some regions, such as the Maldives, they can be seen in very large schools. Phantom bannerfish are found at various depths; they often inhabit shallow reef crests exposed to surge. They prefer mixed algae and coral habitats down to 25 meters, but are also found in deeper, coastal waters.

This is an oviparous species that forms pairs during breeding.
