The **Yellowtail scad (Atule mate)**, or simply Atule, is a widely distributed species of small marine fish inhabiting coastal zones. Its range covers the Indo-Pacific region, from the east coast of Africa in the west to the Hawaiian Islands in the east. To the north, it extends to Japan, and to the south, to Australia.

The Yellowtail scad is the only species in the genus *Atule*, characterized by a well-developed adipose eyelid and elongation of the last rays of the dorsal and anal fins (resembling finlets), distinguishing it from similar species. These fish prefer to inhabit coastal environments such as bays and coral reefs, where they feed on small fish and crustaceans.

The coloration of the Yellowtail scad is characterized by an olive-green hue on top, gradually transitioning to golden-green on the sides [Note: Original text specified ventral side], and then becoming silvery-white below. The fish has nine to 16 vertical gray bars along its sides, as well as a black spot, smaller than the eye, on the upper edge of the operculum and the shoulder area. The caudal and dorsal fins have a characteristic greenish-yellow hue, the pelvic fins are white, and the remaining fins are transparent.
