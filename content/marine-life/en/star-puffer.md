The **Star puffer (Arothron stellatus)** is one of the largest members of the pufferfish genus *Arothron*, reaching lengths of up to 110 cm, although individuals around 60 cm are more commonly encountered. The Star puffer feeds on benthic invertebrates and inhabits depths down to 60 meters, often found on sandy bottoms and coral rubble slopes. This species rarely poses a danger to divers and can be a suitable subject for photography.

Body coloration can vary from brownish to intense orange or bright yellow. Juveniles are characterized by a dense pattern of brownish-black and yellowish-white stripes running from the belly towards the back. With age, this pattern breaks up, transforming into a combination of large spots on the fish's back. The skin of the Star puffer lacks scales and is covered with small spines (spinules). Females are generally lighter in color compared to males and are smaller in size.

The body of the Star puffer is oval-shaped and appears short; the characteristic dorsal fin is set slightly back, and the other fins are relatively short.

The diet of Star puffers includes various types of mollusks, crustaceans, fish, algae, as well as encrusting organisms on reefs and rocks, which the fish easily scrapes off with its unusual fused teeth (beak).

Predatory fish can eat puffers without harm to their health; however, for mammals, including humans, these fish, especially their internal organs and skin, can be deadly dangerous due to the presence of the alkaloid tetrodotoxin.
