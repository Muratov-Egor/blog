**Synaptula lamperti**, or Lambert's Worm Sea Cucumber, is a small, white species of sea cucumber. It prefers to live in groups on the seabed, often in association with sponges. These sea cucumbers have a gherkin-like shape with short tentacles at one end and feed by picking up organic particles from the sponge's surface. The species *Synaptula lamperti* inhabits coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region.

Sea cucumbers belong to the group of echinoderms, which also includes sea urchins and starfish. They possess radial symmetry and a water vascular system that operates using hydrostatic pressure. This allows them to move using suction appendages known as tube feet.
