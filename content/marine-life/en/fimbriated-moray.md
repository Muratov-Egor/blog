The **Fimbriated moray (Gymnothorax fimbriatus)**, also known as the Blackspotted moray.

This is a medium-sized moray eel, reaching a maximum length of up to 80 cm. Its snake-like body has a white to cream or light brown background, dotted with numerous black spots whose size and shape vary depending on the individual and its maturity. The head has a tapering snout that is greenish-yellow with black dots; the corners of the mouth are white.

It is widely distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, mainly on the coastal reefs of oceanic islands from Madagascar to Polynesia, and from southern Japan to New Caledonia.

It inhabits sheltered areas on outer coral reef slopes, reef tops, lagoons, and harbors. During the day, it shelters in crevices at depths ranging from 1 to 50 meters.

It feeds mainly on small fish and crustaceans. It leaves its lair at night to actively hunt for prey along the reef.
