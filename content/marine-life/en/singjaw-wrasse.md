The slingjaw wrasse (Epibulus insidiator) is a remarkable fish known for its ability to extend its jaws forward rapidly, allowing it to catch prey from a considerable distance.

Its coloration changes with age and sex. Juveniles are typically brown with thin white stripes along the sides and pale lines radiating from the eyes. Females can be either bright yellow or dark brown. Adult males have a grayish-brown body, an orange back, a yellow transverse stripe on the sides, and a pale gray head with a thin black stripe running through the eye. This species can grow up to 54 cm in length.

The slingjaw wrasse is a predator, feeding on small fish and crustaceans. Its unique jaw structure enables it to extend its mouth instantly, capturing prey from a distance.

This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, meaning it has the ability to change from female to male during its lifetime. During the breeding season, males display vibrant colors and perform ritualistic circling around females. Spawning occurs in the evening, with the male and female ascending into the water column to release eggs and sperm.

The slingjaw wrasse inhabits coral reefs, lagoons, and sheltered coastal areas, typically found at depths ranging from 1 to 40 meters. Its range extends across the Red Sea, the waters off South Africa, and the western Pacific, including Japan, Hawaii, the Tuamotu Islands, and New Caledonia.

These fish lead a solitary lifestyle and avoid interaction with others of their kind. Their ability to extend their jaws is used not only for hunting but also as a display of dominance toward other individuals.
