Live sharksucker or common remora (Echeneis naucrates), is a species of ray-finned fish from the remora family (Echeneidae). It is widely distributed in the warm tropical and subtropical waters of the world's oceans. Occasionally, it is found in the Primorsky Krai and the Black Sea, having entered these regions by attaching to sharks and turtles.

Its body is dorsally flattened, with a small head and teeth. The first dorsal fin has evolved into a suction disc located on the top of its head, while the remaining fins are positioned closer to the tail. Like all remoras, it lacks a swim bladder. The coloration is dark gray, with a brown stripe running along the body, bordered by a thin white line.

The remora attaches itself to large marine animals, traveling long distances with them, though free-swimming individuals can also be found. Those attached to solitary host animals often form male-female pairs.

Juveniles initially swim freely but begin attaching to moving objects once they reach a length of 40â€“80 millimeters. At this stage, their "hosts" are often smaller fish, such as boxfish and pufferfish.

The maximum length of this species is 110 cm, with a weight of up to 2.3 kg.

The common remora primarily feeds on small fish, such as sardines, herrings, and small jacks. Squid, octopuses, shrimp, and crabs have also been found in their stomachs. Juveniles feed on zooplankton and leftover food from their hosts.

This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems, participating in food chains, cleaning large animals of parasites, and contributing to nutrient redistribution in the water.
