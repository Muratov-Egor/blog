The **Pharaoh cuttlefish (Sepia pharaonis)** is a large species of mollusk, reaching a mantle length of 42 cm and weighing up to 5 kg. This amazing marine inhabitant possesses a large brain relative to its body size and is considered one of the most intelligent mollusks. It looks like a strange and bizarre spaceship from outer space. Pharaoh cuttlefish inhabit the western Indian Ocean. At night, they move into shallower waters to hunt for various fish, crabs, and sometimes even other cuttlefish.

Cuttlefish differ in many ways from familiar marine inhabitants. Their unique propulsion system – swimming backward by jetting water – as well as the ability to instantly change not only the color and texture of their skin but also their body shape, make them truly fascinating. Their skin is adorned with fine, shifting patterns that change depending on the environment. Cuttlefish are ancient representatives of the cephalopod class of mollusks.

Pharaoh cuttlefish prefer areas with medium to high light levels during the day. They typically choose silt-covered bottoms for daytime rest and sandy or clay substrates for nighttime activity.

Cuttlefish have excellent vision, thanks to special filters [likely referring to polarization vision or W-shaped pupils] that enhance visual acuity. Therefore, they notice us much earlier than we notice them. Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish have an internal calcareous shell (cuttlebone) that helps them regulate buoyancy. When threatened, these soft-bodied creatures can change their appearance to blend in with their surroundings, and if that doesn't work, they can eject a cloud of ink and escape.

Cuttlefish are always hungry and constantly searching for food. They eat fish, marine worms, and their favorite prey are small crabs. They hunt by camouflaging themselves against the environment, but if that isn't enough, they can use their abilities to project colorful light pulsations to hypnotize prey and deftly capture it. These cuttlefish are harmless to humans, and one can safely swim near them.
