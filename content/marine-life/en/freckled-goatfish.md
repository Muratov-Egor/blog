The **Freckled Goatfish (Upeneus tragula)** is a medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths of 15 to 20 cm. It has a characteristic elongated body with a slightly compressed shape. The fish's coloration typically ranges from pale pink to reddish with a series of dark brown or black spots scattered along its sides. These spots give it a freckled appearance, which is a key identifying feature. The fish also has two long barbels on its chin, which it uses to detect food on the ocean floor.

The Freckled Goatfish typically inhabits the tropical and subtropical areas of the Indo-Pacific region. It populates sandy and muddy bottoms, often near coral reefs or seagrass beds. These fish are usually found at depths ranging from 1 to 50 meters, where they can easily forage for food.

The Freckled Goatfish reproduces through spawning, where females release eggs into the water column, and males fertilize them externally. The eggs are pelagic, meaning they float in open water until hatching. The larvae then develop and settle on the seabed as they mature.

The Freckled Goatfish feeds mainly on small invertebrates, such as crustaceans, worms, and mollusks. It uses its sensitive barbels to detect prey hidden in the sand or mud.

The Freckled Goatfish poses no danger to divers. It is usually shy and swims away when approached.
