The **Bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii)**, sometimes known as the Smooth cornetfish or Whistlefish, is a distinctive, elongated fish inhabiting tropical and subtropical coral reefs. It populates coral reefs, seagrass beds, and coastal lagoons. It is commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to Hawaii, and from Japan to New South Wales.

They are found in various lengths: adults typically reach up to 1 meter, but specimens up to 1.5 meters are sometimes encountered. Their body is covered with small ctenoid scales (a type of bony scale found in ray-finned fishes). It has a very interesting appearance: an elongated body and a long head with large jaws – the snout accounts for almost a quarter of the total body length. The main body coloration is silvery with a bluish sheen, and the back is greenish.

Cornetfish typically reproduce in warm waters. They reproduce through external fertilization: females release eggs into the water while males simultaneously release sperm, leading to fertilization. The eggs are pelagic, meaning they float in the water column until they hatch. The larvae are also pelagic and go through several stages before settling in reef areas.

Cornetfish are predators and feed mainly on small fish and crustaceans. They use their elongated snouts to rapidly suck in prey.

The Bluespotted cornetfish generally poses no danger to divers. They are shy and tend to avoid contact with humans. However, like all marine life, they should be observed from a distance to avoid causing stress to the animal or provoking an unintentional reaction.
