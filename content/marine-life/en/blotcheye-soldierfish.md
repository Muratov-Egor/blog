The Murdjan, also known as the **Blotcheye soldierfish (Myripristis murdjan)**, is a species of marine fish belonging to the soldierfish and squirrelfish family (Holocentridae), order Holocentriformes. They inhabit the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

Their body is covered with ctenoid scales, with the body length being 2.4–2.5 times the body depth, and the head length is contained 2.8–3.2 times in standard length. They have large eyes. The lower limb of the first gill arch has 19 to 33 gill rakers, while the upper limb has 13. The interorbital space is wide. The lower jaw protrudes slightly when the mouth is closed.

The Murdjan has 11 spines and 13–15 soft rays in the dorsal fin, and 4 spines and 11–15 soft rays in the anal fin. Their lateral line consists of 27–29 scales.

The coloration of their body and head is silvery-pink, with reddish scale edges. The edge of the gill cover (operculum) can be dark brown or black. A dark vertical bar runs through the eye to its lower edge. The spinous part of the dorsal fin is red, as are the other fins. The upper edges of the soft part of the dorsal fin and all fins have a white margin. Sometimes the unpaired fins (dorsal, anal, caudal) may have black tips.

The maximum body length of the Murdjan reaches 60 cm, although they usually do not exceed 20 cm.

These fish inhabit coastal reef zones and lead a predominantly nocturnal lifestyle, hiding during the day in crevices and under reef overhangs. They usually do not descend deeper than 10 m, but have been observed down to 50 m. They feed both in the water column and near the bottom, with their diet primarily consisting of meroplankton, including crab and shrimp larvae, as well as polychaete worms.
